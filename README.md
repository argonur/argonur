### 👋 Hi, I’m Arturo
I’m an Electrical Electronic Engineer from 🇲🇽 with a Master’s in Automation & IT from 🇩🇪.  
I’ve worked on PLCs, embedded systems, and industrial automation — and somehow ended up loving C++ almost as much as electricity ⚡💻  

- 👀 I’m interested in **automation, control systems, embedded development, and quantitative investing**.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **how to merge industrial automation principles with financial modeling and data-driven decision systems**.  
- 💞️ I’m working on **a modular investment system** that evaluates market conditions using indicators like VIX, Shiller PE, and sentiment indexes — combining finance, math, and software engineering 🧠📈  
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborations on **automation software, industrial simulation, or financial analytics tools**.  
- 📫 How to reach me: **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arturo-g-544472268/)** or **GitHub discussions**.
